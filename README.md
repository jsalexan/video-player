  ## Description
  JavaScript30 Project #11 - HTML Video Player
  <br><br>

  These code exercises use the following technologies: JavaScript. HTML. CSS
  <br><br>
  In this application, I created a custom interface for an HTML video player, including pause, play, and skip buttons, volume and speed sliders, and a scrub function.
  <br><br>
  This was a great exercise in using event listeners and query selectors, along with making formulas. 
  
  I had a little trouble in the middle because my browser opened Microsoft Edge instead of Chrome and the skip buttons don't work in ME. But after solving that, it was smooth sailing. 

  I put some notes in the script file. I'm planning to work on this a little more to add a few more functions.
